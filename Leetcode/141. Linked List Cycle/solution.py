# Why & How?

'''
Create Fast and slow pointer, which initially are head.
When only there exist fast, fast.next and fast.next.next get next linked list 
value for slow and fast pointer. If the linked list has cycle in it, both slow and fast
meets one day, returns True, else return False

The "trick" is to not check all the time whether we have reached the end but to handle it via an exception.Â "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."
